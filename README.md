# Open Games Framework

## Description

The **Open Games Framework** is a thesis project focused on modeling and analyzing compositional structures in game theory. It leverages **Idris2**, a dependently typed programming language, to ensure correctness and expressiveness in defining games and their properties. The framework is built on category-theoretic principles, providing a robust foundation for reasoning about games in a modular and extensible way.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and set up the development environment using **Nix**. Detailed instructions will be provided in future updates.
